/*
Allows for simple and complex interpolation

Extend from end of loop certain amount

Linear extrapolation to "slide" back to new loop value

Could be an audio effect MAYBE
    have to consider ramifications of this (interpolating audio when it's not desired)
    not able to "know" when it should interpolate?
